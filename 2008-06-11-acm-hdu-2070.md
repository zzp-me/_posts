# 问题描述

## Problem Description

Your objective for this question is to develop a program which will generate a fibbonacci number. The fibbonacci function is defined as such:

    f(0) = 0
    f(1) = 1
    f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)

Your program should be able to handle values of n in the range 0 to 50.

## Input

Each test case consists of one integer n in a single line where 0≤n≤50. The input is terminated by -1.

## Output

Print out the answer in a single line for each test case.

## Sample Input

    3
    4
    5
    -1

## Sample Output

    2
    3
    5
